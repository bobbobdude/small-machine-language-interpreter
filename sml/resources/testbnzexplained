f0 lin 1 10 // Store 10 in register 1
f1 lin 2 5 // Store 5 in register 2
f3 lin 3 1 // Store 1 in register 3
f4 sub 1 1 3 // Subtract contents of register 3 from 1 and store result in register 1 (10 - 1)
f5 sub 2 2 3 // Subtract contents of register 3 from 2 and store result in register 2 (5 - 1)
f6 bnz 2 f4 // Check if register 2 contains zero, if it does not jump up to instruction f4 and repeat until register 2 equals zero

This should in theory minus one from 10 5 times resulting in register 1 being 5, register 2 being 0 and register 3 being 1.
